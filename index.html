                <p>Majin Vegeta is the form Vegeta became when he became a follower of Babidi.</p>

                <p>When Babidi attempted to mystically take control of Vegeta, he invaded his mind, something he could
                    only achieve because of the hidden depths of evil lurking within his heart. This action was Babidi's
                    last defence in an effort to use him against the other Z Fighters. It is revealed that Vegeta could
                    have stopped his possession but willingly chose to let Babidi take control of his body, believing
                    that by awakening the evil intentions within himself he would finally be able to defeat Goku. As he
                    fought along side the Z Fighters during the years and grew attached to his new home on Earth and his
                    family, Vegeta struggled to hold onto his merciless dark side which he believed was the true source
                    of his power.

                    is the result of the Innocent Buu using fission to split into good and evil halves. He would go on
                    to become a member of the Z Fighters and live with Mr. Satan. After the battle against the pure
                    Majin Buu, Buu is referred to as Buu instead of Majin Buu and to the world he becomes Mr. Buu.

                    Good Buu possesses the Grand Supreme Kai (大界王神 Dai Kaiōshin, lit. "Great God of the Kings of the
                    Worlds*) as part of his being and eventually fully awakened this part of himself. </p>
